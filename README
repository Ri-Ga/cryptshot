Scripts that I wrote to perform various backup tasks

- db-backup.py
    Backup databases! See source for configuration and usage.

    I like to use email for remote backups. It's cheap (a free Gmail account
    providies 7+ gigs of storage) and one-way: if an attacker breaks into my
    server, he can see what address I'm sending backups to, but is going to
    have a difficult time accessing and altering those backups.

    But email is sent across the internets in plain text and (in my case) I do
    not control the destination server. Thus, the backups must be encrypted.
    I use GPG's symmetric encryption for this. It gets the job done and is
    simpler than asymmetric encryption with keys.

- clean.sh
    Simple bash script to delete backups older than 60 days.
